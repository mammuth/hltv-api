# HLTV API (inofficial)

### Features
- Get ical file for upcoming matches
- Json API for upcoming matches, filterable by teams

### Status
This is pretty unfinished and in a very early stage. 
Don't expect much enhancements in the near future. 
This is mainly because the underlying wrapper ([HLTV-Go](https://github.com/Olament/HLTV-Go)) doesn't support that many features yet.
